# User Stories for EventSync
## Current Features
These are features that are currently implemented in EventSync, and which feature on the landing page.

### Illustrated Features
1. As a busy college student, I want to have event details from my emails and messages sync to my Google Calendar so I can confirm them.

2. As someone wanting to hang out with my friends, I want to be able to share my calendar with my friends so I can get the best suggestion on meeting time instead of using when2meet.

3. As a busy student, I want recurring events (e.g. "let's meet every Friday") to automatically show up so I don't have to manually create repeat events in my calendar.

### Other Features
4. As a student in many different club calendars, I want to be able to hide events on a shared calendar instead of deleting them.

5. As someone who struggles with making concrete plans, I want to be able to turn casual discussions into actual plans with a reminder to finalize vague details.

6. As a busy college student, I want events that I cancel over email/text to automatically update so I don't have to manually change my calendar.

## Potential Features Expansion
7. As someone who wants to better explore the city, I want to get nearby restaurants or cafes suggestions for my planned events.

8. As a busy student, I want certain events (e.g. class, club meetings) to be prioritized and blocked in my calendar, so I don't accidentally overcommit.

9. As a student looking for internships, I want to get notifications for follow-ups after events to better maintain connections (e.g. "Send thank you email")

10. As a student, I want to receive notifications if I attempt to schedule an event that conflicts with an existing commitment to avoid double-booking.

11. As a traveler, I want to be able to convert timezone differences automatically when planning events so I don't schedule at the wrong time when traveling.

12. As a frequent traveler, I want to receive suggestions on appropriate buffer times between meetings or travel plans (like layovers) so I'm not rushing or running late.

13. As someone trying to get new and better habits, I want to get predictive rescheduling suggestions (e.g. going to the gym in the morning) so it shows up in the calendar and adapts.

14. As a busy student, I want to be able to automatically analyze my past schedules and suggest optimal routines (e.g. you have a 1.5 hour gap in between classes, schedule meetings then?).

15. As a busy student, I want to be able to sync with a task manager (e.g. Notion) to convert tasks into time blocks for better planning.
